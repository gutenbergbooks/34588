<h2>NOTE.</h2>

<p>Sixteen of these Twenty Fables have been handed down to us in a
Greek form: for these Halm's text has been used. As to the other
four&mdash;Number IX. is from Phaedrus, and retains a flavour of artificiality;
Numbers XIII. and XX. are from Latin versions; and Number X. is
from a French one.</p>

<p>The Translations aim at replacing the florid style of our older English
versions, and the stilted harshness of more modern ones, by a plainness
and terseness more nearly like the character of the originals.</p>

<p>In the following cases the Translations have been adapted to the
Designs. In Number I. <i>cheese</i> has been put for <i>meat</i>; in Number VIII.
a <i>pack of Hounds</i> for a <i>Lion</i>; in Number XI. a <i>Stork</i> for a <i>Crane</i>;
in Number XIX. a <i>Frog</i> for a <i>Toad</i>; and in Number VII. the Dog
should be <i>tied up</i>. The reason of this is, that in the collaboration the
Designer and Translator have not been on terms of equal authority;
the former has stood unshakeably by English tradition, and has had
his own way.</p>

<h3>THE FOX AND THE CROW.</h3>


<p>A Crow stole a piece of cheese and alighted with it on a tree.
A Fox watched her, and wishing to get hold of the cheese stood
underneath and began to make compliments upon her size and beauty;
he went so far as to say that she had the best of claims to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Queen of the Birds, and doubtless it would have been done if she
had only had a voice. The Crow, anxious to prove to him that she
did possess a voice, began to caw vigorously, of course dropping the
cheese. The Fox pounced upon it and carried it off, remarking as
he went away, "My good friend Crow, you have every good quality:
now try to get some common sense."</p>

<h3>THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN.</h3>


<p>An Ass who had dressed himself up in a Lion's skin was mistaken
by everybody for a lion, and there was a stampede of
both herds and men. But presently the skin was whisked off
by a gust of wind, and the Ass stood exposed; and then the
men all charged at him, and with sticks and cudgels gave him a
sound drubbing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE FISHERMAN AND THE LITTLE FISH.</h3>


<p>A Fisherman cast his net and caught a little Fish. The
little Fish begged him to let him go for the present, as he
was so small, and to catch him again to more purpose later on,
when he was bulkier. But the Fisherman said: "Nay, I should
be a very simpleton to let go a good thing I have got and run
after a doubtful expectation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE JACKDAW AND THE DOVES.</h3>


<p>A Jackdaw observing how well cared for were the Doves in a
certain dovecote, whitewashed himself and went to take a part
in the same way of living. The Doves were friendly enough so long
as he kept silence, taking him for one of themselves; but when he
once forgot himself and gave a croak they immediately perceived
his character, and cuffed him out. So the Jackdaw, having failed
in getting a share of good things there, returned to his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Jackdaws. But these latter not recognising him, because of his
colour, kept him out of their mess also; so that in his desire
for two things he got neither.</p>

<h3>THE COPPERSMITH AND HIS PUPPY.</h3>


<p>A certain Coppersmith had a Puppy. While the Coppersmith
was at work the Puppy lay asleep; but when meal-time
came he woke up. So his master, throwing him a bone, said:
"You sleepy little wretch of a Puppy, what shall I do with you,
you inveterate sluggard? When I am thumping on my anvil you
can go to sleep on the mat; but when I come to work my teeth
immediately you are wide awake and wagging your tail at me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE FROGS DESIRING A KING.</h3>


<p>The Frogs were grieved at their own lawless condition, so they
sent a deputation to Zeus begging him to provide them with
a King. Zeus, perceiving their simplicity, dropped a Log of wood
into the pool. At first the Frogs were terrified by the splash, and
dived to the bottom; but after a while, seeing the Log remain
motionless, they came up again, and got to despise it so much
that they climbed up and sat on it. Dissatisfied with a King like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
that, they came again to Zeus and entreated him to change their
ruler for them, the first being altogether too torpid. Then Zeus
was exasperated with them, and sent them a Stork, by whom they
were seized and eaten up.</p>

<p>A Wolf, seeing a large Dog with a collar on, asked him:

<h3>THE STAG LOOKING INTO THE WATER.</h3>


<p>A Stag parched with thirst came to a spring of water. As
he was drinking he saw his own reflection on the water,
and was in raptures with his horns when he observed their splendid
size and shape, but was troubled about his legs, they seemed so
thin and weak. As he was still musing, some huntsmen with a
pack of hounds appeared and disturbed him, whereupon the Stag
took to flight, and keeping a good distance ahead so long as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
plain was free from trees, he was being saved; but when he
came to a woody place he got his horns entangled in the branches,
and being unable to move was seized by the hounds. When he
was at the point of death he said to himself: "What a fool am I,
who was on the way to be saved by the very things which I thought
would fail me; while by those in which I so much trusted I am
brought to ruin."</p>

<h3>THE FROGS AND THE FIGHTING BULLS.</h3>


<p>A Frog in his marsh looking at some Bulls fighting,
exclaimed: "O dear! what sad destruction threatens us
now!" Another Frog asked him why he said that, seeing that the
Bulls were only fighting for the first place in the herd, and that

<h3>THE LION AND OTHER BEASTS.</h3>


<p>The Lion one day went out hunting along with three other
Beasts, and they caught a Stag. With the consent of the
others the Lion divided it, and he cut it into four equal portions;
but when the others were going to take hold of their shares,
"Gently, my friends," said the Lion; "the first of these portions
is mine, as one of the party; the second also is mine, because of
my rank among beasts; the third you will yield me as a tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to my courage and nobleness of character; while, as to the fourth,&mdash;why,
if any one wishes to dispute with me for it, let him begin,
and we shall soon see whose it will be."</p>

<p>The Fox poured out some rich soup upon a flat dish, tantalising

being a liquid, foiled all the efforts of his slender beak. In return
for this, when the Stork invited the Fox, he brought the dinner
on the table in a jug with a long narrow neck, so that while he
himself easily inserted his beak and took his fill, the Fox was
unable to do the same, and so was properly paid off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a Horse who had a meadow all to himself until
a Stag came and began to injure the pasture. The Horse,
eager to punish the Stag, asked a man whether there was any
way of combining to do this. "Certainly," said the Man, "if you
don't object to a bridle and to my mounting you with javelins in
my hand." The Horse agreed, and was mounted by the Man;
but, instead of being revenged on the Stag, he himself became
a servant to the Man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>An Ass and a Cock were in a shed. A hungry Lion caught

shed to devour him. But he took fright at the sound of the Cock
crowing (for people say that Lions are afraid at the voice of a
Cock), and turned away and ran. The Ass, roused to a lofty
contempt of him for being afraid of a Cock, went out to pursue
him; but when they were some distance away the Lion ate him up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.</h3>


<p>A Wolf seeing a Lamb drinking at a brook, took it into his
head that he would find some plausible excuse for eating him.
So he drew near, and, standing higher up the stream, began to
accuse him of disturbing the water and preventing him from
drinking.</p>

<p>The Lamb replied that he was only touching the water with
the tips of his lips; and that, besides, seeing that he was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
down stream, he could not possibly be disturbing the water higher
up. So the Wolf, having done no good by that accusation, said:
"Well, but last year you insulted my Father." The Lamb replying
that at that time he was not born, the Wolf wound up by saying:
"However ready you may be with your answers, I shall none the
less make a meal of you."</p>

<h3>THE MAN AND HIS TWO WIVES.</h3>


<p>A Man whose hair was turning gray had two Wives, one

at being married to a man younger than herself, and made it a
practice whenever he was with her to pick out all his black hairs;
while the younger, anxious to conceal the fact that she had an
elderly husband, used, similarly, to pull out the gray ones. So,
between them, it ended in the Man being completely plucked, and
becoming bald.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL.</h3>


<p>A Fox had had his tail docked off in a trap, and in his disgrace
began to think his life not worth living. It therefore
occurred to him that the best thing he could do was to bring the
other Foxes into the same condition, and so conceal his own
deficiency in the general distress. Having assembled them all
together he recommended them to cut off their tails, declaring that
a tail was an ungraceful thing; and, further, was a heavy appendage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and quite superfluous. To this one of them rejoined: "My good
friend, if this had not been to your own advantage you would
never have advised us to do it."</p>

<h3>THE EAGLE AND THE FOX.</h3>


<p>An Eagle and a Fox entered into a covenant of mutual affection
and resolved to live near one another, looking upon close
intercourse as a way of strengthening friendship. Accordingly the
former flew to the top of a high tree and built her nest, while
the latter went into a bush at the foot and placed her litter there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
One day, however, when the Fox was away foraging, the Eagle,
being hard pressed for food, swooped down into the bush, snatched
up the cubs and helped her own fledglings to devour them. When
the Fox came back and saw what had happened she was not so
much vexed at the death of her young ones as at the impossibility
of requital. For the Eagle having wings and she none, pursuit
was impossible. So she stood some distance away and did all
that is left for the weak and impotent to do&mdash;poured curses on
her foe. But the Eagle was not to put off for long the punishment
due to her violation of the sacred tie of friendship. It happened
that some country-people were sacrificing a goat, and the Eagle
flew down and carried away from the altar some of the burning
flesh. But when she had got it to her eyrie a strong wind got
up and kindled into flame the thin dry twigs of the nest, so that
the eaglets, being too young to be able to fly, were roasted, and
fell to the ground. Then the Fox ran up and, before the Eagle's
eyes, devoured them every one.</p>

ago a great big four-legged thing came up and crushed him dead
with his hoof." Thereupon the Frog began to puff herself out and
ask whether the animal was as big as that. "Stop, mother, don't
put yourself about," they said; "you will burst in two long before
you can make yourself the same size as that beast."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
